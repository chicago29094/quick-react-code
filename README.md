# quick-react-code

Quick-React is VS Code extension developed to make the development of hook-based React projects faster, by eliminating many of the manual setup steps.  Although scripts such as **create-react-app**, initialize a great deal of the scaffolding for a typical SPA Website, project setup could benefit from additional configuration assistance, as long as the process is simple, intuitive, and fast.

## Features

Quick-React addresses the need for faster development by utilizing a simple JSX-style markup format, in an easy to understand outline format, that is parsed by the Quick-React VS Code extension.  The parsed data is then used to generate directories and files directly into your project.  Attributes specified in markup components are used to enable or disable React features to be incorporated into the target project.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following user settings:

* `quickReact.files.confirmOverwrite`: enable/disable confirmation prompt to overwrite existing files

## Known Issues / Future Updates

- We are actively testing more edge cases and more complex markup.
- In-editor syntax highlighting, checking, and assistance within VS Code would be helpful when coding Quick-React project markup.
- A template based approach to component generation would add flexibility for users instead of fixed boilerplate content.
- More flexibility can be developed for sequenced markup attributes.
- Direct injection of components into files such as index.js and App.js would be a powerful addition.
- Direct in-place replacement of some of the other create-react-app generic boilerplate would add flexibility to the Quick-React system.
